# User Interface Guidelines
scope: {index.html,css/**/*.css,js/**/*(ui|UI)*.js}

## UI Design Principles
- Use vibrant, childlike colors for all UI elements
- Implement a clean, minimal HUD displaying essential information
- Create playful, large button styles for menus
- Follow a consistent color scheme with the 3D game elements

## Main Menu
- Implement a simple, clear start screen with minimal options
- Include basic instructions for how to play the game
- Add options for basic settings (audio on/off, controls info)
- Design for both mouse/touch interaction

## In-Game HUD
- Display current sphere size prominently
- Show size threshold progress for next milestone
- Keep UI elements minimal to avoid cluttering the game view
- Position elements at screen edges to maximize gameplay visibility

## Mobile UI Adaptations
- Design larger touch targets for mobile interfaces
- Implement on-screen controls as fallback for device orientation
- Ensure UI is responsive across different screen sizes
- Apply proper touch event handling for all interactive elements

## Styling and CSS
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Implement proper responsive design with media queries
- Create smooth transitions for UI element changes
- Follow a cheerful, rainbow-inspired color scheme
