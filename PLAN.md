# Current state
Ongoing task number: Completed
Tasks completed: 1-13

# List of task:
✅ Task 1: Set up the basic project folder structure (index.html, main.js, etc.) to organize all game files.
✅ Task 2: Integrate Three.js and initialize a minimal 3D scene with a camera and renderer.
✅ Task 3: Create a central "sticky sphere" player object with basic geometry and a ground plane.
✅ Task 4: Implement keyboard-based movement controls (e.g., WASD or arrow keys) to roll the sphere.
✅ Task 5: Add an object manager to spawn random geometric shapes (cube, sphere, cone) with various sizes and rainbow-like colors.
✅ Task 6: Implement collision detection (bounding sphere checks) to identify when the player sphere collides with smaller objects.
✅ Task 7: Add absorption logic that destroys the smaller object and increases the player sphere's size upon collision.
✅ Task 8: Set up camera adjustments so it gradually zooms out as the sphere grows in diameter.
✅ Task 9: Display a basic HUD (e.g., a small overlay) showing the player sphere's current size.
✅ Task 10: Integrate optional mobile tilt controls or on-screen buttons for touch-based movement.
✅ Task 11: Implement simple performance optimizations by capping total spawned objects and removing off-screen items.
✅ Task 12: Polish scene visuals (fun colors, simple animations) to reinforce a whimsical, Katamari-like style.
✅ Task 13: Finalize and refine all code to ensure the MVP runs smoothly in the browser from the index.html file.

# Implementation Notes

## Architecture Overview
- Core game loop implemented with Three.js for rendering
- Physics-based movement with collision detection
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns (input, physics, objects, camera)
- Mobile support with both tilt controls and touchscreen fallback
- Performance optimizations (object culling, capping max objects)

## Features Implemented
- Rolling sphere that grows by absorbing smaller objects
- Multiple geometric shapes (cubes, spheres, cones, cylinders)
- Rainbow color palette for all objects
- Camera that zooms out as the player grows
- HUD showing current sphere size
- Level progression with new object types unlocked as player grows
- Mobile controls (device orientation and on-screen buttons)
- Debug tools for troubleshooting (can be removed for production)

## Recent Fixes
- Fixed rendering issues with canvas positioning and z-index
- Added debug panel for easier troubleshooting
- Improved camera initialization and positioning
- Fixed game loop and error handling
- Added detailed console logging
- Fixed NaN issue with box/cube collisions
- Implemented fixed camera with rotation controls for better gameplay
- Added error handling to prevent crashes

## Control System
- WASD or Arrow Keys:
  - W/Up: Move forward in the direction the camera is facing
  - S/Down: Move backward
  - A/Left: Rotate the camera counter-clockwise
  - D/Right: Rotate the camera clockwise
- Camera stays fixed at an angle and rotates around the player
- Movement is always relative to the camera view

## Future Enhancements
- Sound effects or background music
- Victory condition and end screen
- More complex level designs with ramps or obstacles
- Visual attachments showing absorbed objects on the sphere's surface
- High score tracking with localStorage
- More elaborate visual effects and animations

## How to Play
1. Open index.html in a modern web browser
2. Click "Start Game" on the menu
3. Use WASD or arrow keys to control the sphere:
   - W/Up Arrow: Move forward
   - S/Down Arrow: Move backward
   - A/Left Arrow: Turn left (camera rotates)
   - D/Right Arrow: Turn right (camera rotates)
4. Absorb smaller objects to grow
5. Try to reach the largest size possible!

On mobile devices, the game automatically switches to tilt controls or provides on-screen buttons for movement.

## Troubleshooting
If the game doesn't appear to be working:
1. Check the debug panel in the top-right corner
2. Ensure WebGL is supported in your browser
3. Check console for any JavaScript errors
